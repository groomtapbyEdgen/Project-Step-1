HR Team Survey Analysis Project Step


Dear Peter,

As I mentioned during our call regarding the HR team's request for a quick analysis of their survey, I'm writing to provide you with more details.

For background, they conducted an Employee Happiness Survey about the policies we have in our AtliQ office.

All their requirements are listed as tasks in the attached Jupyter notebook, present in the cell section.

Here are a few more instructions:

Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey, and work on the Assignment.
Now run the Jupyter Notebook in this folder. You will see This files:
Assignment notebook that will contain detailed instructions on the assignment.
As a sincere learner, you will first try the solution on your own and later on I will share the solution file with ours 😊

Good luck with this Project Step!
